fly_tracker
===========

A short little MATLAB script that tracks flies.

To do list:
+ Create probability distribution and statistics (probability key/legend for heatmap would be nice).
+ Create "teleportation filter" that excludes frames where the fly position teleports across the vial.
+ Improve background image subtraction.
