fly_tracker
===========

A short little MATLAB script that tracks flies.

To analyze a video, edit the flytrack_video.m script and run it. This creates a .csv that can be used to calculate interfly distance and produce a heatmap of where the flies went during the course of the assay (generally use this script once on all files for each genotype/test condition). The stats script creates a .csv of interfly distance for that genotype. The boxPlotter.m script can be used to create a box-and-whisker plot to show and compare the amount of time flies spent below a certain "distance threshold" specified by the user.
