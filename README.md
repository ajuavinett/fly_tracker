fly_tracker
===========

A short little MATLAB script that tracks flies.

To do list:
+ Find a way to "smooth" fly path. 
+ Create probability distribution and statistics.
+ Create "teleportation filter" that excludes frames where the fly position teleports across the vial.
+ Track second ROI and calculate distance between flies in both ROIs.
